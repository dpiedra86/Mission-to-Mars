# Mission tom Mars


## Project Overviews
> The project objective was to write a script to retrieve information from different webpages in an automatically way. 
This is the link between functions and user interfaces that live in the wabe and how they connect within flask. Then the user interface is diplayed in HTML with Boostrap libraries.
We also used mongo as our prefered database storage.
